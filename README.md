Here is the source code for a personal website I made while attempting to learn HTML and CSS.
Is it bad? Probably. Is it perfect? I doubt it. But I would say it has done its job well and
was a good way of getting me to learn the two while also providing a productive purpose (as
a portfolio of sorts). I'll probably continue to update this as I improve and if I continue
to enjoy this I might try getting into freelance web development. Who knows.
