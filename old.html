        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Carl Replogle</strong> and I am a 17 year old student attending the Summit Country Day School. As a bit of a challenge and a way of learning, I decided to make a website for myself. Listed below are some buttons that can navigate you to different areas of the site.</p>

        <h2 id=extracurriculars>Here are some things I've done recently:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="EC"><strong>Internship at Cincinnati Sports Medicine:</strong> Over the summer of 2021, I participated in an internship with Dr. Samer Hasan, assisting with tabulating data for clinical research in anatomic shoulder replacements with altivate implants. More on this soon as it finishes up. </li>
            <li class="EC"><strong>Biomolecular Modeling Club:</strong> This club created 3D models of the proteins neuroglobin and TRPV1. As a group of a couple people, we presented our models and findings at a science confrence. I wrote my common app essay about how my experiences loving spicy foods throughout my life  led me to model the TRPV1 protein, which is better known as the cell receptor which causes the perception of spice.</li>
            
            <li class="EC"><strong>Swimming:</strong> I am a four year varsity member of my schools swim team. When I began as a freshman, I was the only male swimmer in my grade and the team was generally small. I greatly enjoyed the experience and over the next few years I helped grow the team. I have played a role in turning several boys in my grade into sprint freestylers, recruited younger swimmers to join Summit, and this year is shaping up to be the Boy's teams first ever conference win. </li>
            
            
            <li class="EC"><strong>Lifeguarding:</strong> Over the summers of 2020 and 2021, I have worked as a lifeguard for SwimSafe pool management. Training for this involved CPR training and multiple different rescue maneuvers. I generally worked 25 hours a week over both summers. </li>
            
            <li class="EC"><strong>Academic Team:</strong> For the past three years, I've participated in Academic Team. Some readers might more commonly know this as "quiz bowl". Formatted similar to jeopardy, this involves students buzzing in to answer challenging trivia questions on topics ranging from geography to Russian composers. For senior year, I am considered a club leader along with a close friend of mine, Jimmy Fraley. </li>
            
            <li class="EC"><strong>Student Leadership:</strong> At my school, there is no student council system where different roles are elected. There is however an application based leadership team system. For my junior and senior years (the years this system has existed), I have been as a member of the two teams. We coordinate assemblies and school-wide activities as a large group. This year my subgroup, peer mentoring, is involved with the school's open house alongside assisting the incoming freshmen. </li>
            
            <li class="EC"><em>and even more!</em></li>
        </ul>

        <p id=bottom>This website is a shell I used to learn html. You should be able to view the code itself by using inspect element. I made this website in 1 night, and it is not hard to learn HTML with a bit of time and persistence. I'll be off now to learn some css and make a more modern looking website.</p>
